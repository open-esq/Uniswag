# now-env

_This package has now been deprecated with the [release of `now dev`](https://zeit.co/blog/now-dev). We recommend setting environment variables either by [using a `.env` file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/development/environment-variables/#using-a-.env-file), or inside a [`now.json` file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/development/environment-variables/#using-now.json). For more information you should read the [full documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/development/environment-variables)._
